# Fill in the Blanks

![Fill in the Blanks example]()

Fill in the blank cards allow users to enter their own answers within a series
of defined blank spaces.

Answers are surrounded by the underscore character (`_`), e.g. \_chicken\_

Multiple answers for a blank space can be defined via the pipe character (`|`), e.g. \_AUS|Australia\_

## Example

# Fill in the gaps
The word chook, also know as _chicken_, is a word commonly used in _AUS|Australia_.
```
